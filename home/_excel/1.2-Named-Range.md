Creating a named range in excel can be extremely useful as they can be absolute references, constants, dynamic and contain formulas. They allow for easy use within formulas,  increase readability and simplify selection of data which is also transferable into any VB code or even Power Query. When a workbook has named ranges it can be easy to understand what formulas are doing and what the data is for someone who didn't create the workbook. 

When selecting a rance and creating it into a table `Ctrl + T` Excel will automatically make this a named range called Table1 increment it accordingly as named ranges must be called something unique.
