## Simple Functions

### IF Function

The Excel IF function is a logic test which either returns a `True` OR `FALSE` result. This function is perfect to filter results, check data, complete different formulas depending on results and also be able to be nested to test for a variety of conditions. It's probabily one of Excels most popular functions

#### Syntax for IF Functions:

The function follows the following logic:

`=IF(logic_test,[value_if_true],[value_if_false])`

**Example 1**

Let's start with with a simple Yes or No result for if students pass their assessment here we use `=IF(A2>0.5,"Yes","No")` since the data in the column A is in decimal values  shown in the percentage number format, where 0.5 is 50%.

For this example the returned value is text defined by `" "`, but we could have this as anything we want, so something like `=IF(A2>0.5,"Pass","Fail")` could also be used here.
We also use the logic operator `>` which means greater than but we can also use different operators.

| Logic Operator | Meaning                  |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| =              | Equal to                 |
| <              | Less than                |
| >              | Greater than             |
| <=             | Less than or equal to    |
| >=             | Greater than or equal to |
| <>             | not equal to             |

**Example 2**

Now we can also complete formulas depending on the logic test. Say we measure temperature before and after and we only want to take the temperature change if it was recorded.

Using `=IF(E3<>0,D3-E3,"No End Recorded")` if the End Temperature Column doesn't equal 0, then calculate the difference otherwise return `No End Recorded` text.

This examples shows the use of formulas as the true result and a text result for the false result.

**Example 3**

The IF Function can also be combined with the AND/OR criteria. This introduces multiple criteria to the IF Function. In this example we want a White Toyota, where in column J we assign the pick if the car is either a Toyota OR White, whereas in column K we assign the pick if the car is both White AND a Toyota.

### IFS Function

The IF Function can be nested to capture multiple criteria, but this can be difficult where there are several criteria. To complete the same purpose the IFS Function can be used which follows the following logic:

`=IFS(logic_test1,value_if_true_1,...)`

**Example 3**

This example uses multiple criteria to give resulting grades over certain mark ranges. Where if the logic test doesn't fall within the range then a `Fail` grade is given.

As mentioned before a nested IF Function can also be used:

`=IF(A2>85,"High Distinction",IF(A2>75,"Distinction",IF(A2>65,"Credit",IF(A2>50,"Pass","Fail"))))`

Whilst the IFS Function used is:

`=IFS(A2>85,"High Distinction",A2>75,"Distinction",A2>65,"Credit",A2>50,"Pass",TRUE,"Fail")`

The formula for both are about the same length, but keeping track of brackets and commas can lead to easy formula errors.

Both results from both the IFS and IF Function are put side on.

### SUM Function 

The SUM Function results the total of a range of numbers using:

`=SUM(number1, number2, ...)`

Completing this function can also be done automatically using AutoSum in the Home Ribbon within the Editing group. Just select the cell at the bottom of th values and it will sum the column.

**Example 4**

In this example selecting `E14` and clicking the AutoSum command will sum the Total column `E` similarly this can be completing using the forumla `=SUM(E2:E13)`

### SUMIF Function

In Example 4 the total cost of Pencils are calculated using the SUMIF Function which is similar to the previous function IFS statment previously mentioned. The SUMIF Function follows the logic below:

`=SUMIF(range, criteria, [sum range])` where for Example 4 the formula in cell E15 is `=SUMIF(B2:B13,"Pencil",E2:E13)`

### SUMIFS Function

This function is again similar to the SUMIF Function but where `=SUMIFS(sum_range, criteria_range1, criteria1, criteria_range2, criteria 2, ...)` Which is much more useful when dealing with multiple criteria and ranges.

### COUNT Functions

There are multiple count functions which can be useful depending on the type of data or filtering you require.

`=COUNT(value1, value2, ...)` incrementally adds to the count for the set values selected or over a range.

`=COUNTIF(range, criteria)` only adds to the count if the set criteria is TRUE.
