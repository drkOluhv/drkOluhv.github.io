## About Excel

Excel allows you to organise data in the format of rows and columns with the use of mathematical functions which are useful for:

- Data Entry, Analysis and Management
- Visualisation of Data and Graphs
- Financial Modeling, Accounting and Budgeting
- Programming

These are just some of the few uses for Excel! But the uses of this program is really limitless in what you'd like to create.

## Overview

Excels interface is built up of your top **Ribbon** and the current **Sheet**. Your Excel file is referred to as a **Workbook** which is made out of multiple Sheets. Each Sheet has rows labeled in number format and columns labeled in letter format.

A **cell** refers to a single box which has a reference to where the column and row intersect to meet this single box.

Here we are in Sheet1 and Cell Reference B2. At the top shows the workbook name of Book1.
