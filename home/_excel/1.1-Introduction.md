## Overview

Excels interface is built up of your top **Ribbon** and the current **Sheet**. Your Excel file is refered to as a **Workbook** which is made out of multiple **Sheets**. Each **Sheet** has rows labeled in number format and columns labeled in letter format.

A **cell** refers to a single box which has a reference to where the column and row intersect to meet this single box.
