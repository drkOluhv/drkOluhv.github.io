Dark Olive Grove is run by a small team where all our content is created by a single person that has a passion for teaching and sharing knowledge with others. Here we cover technical and non-technical topics from creating a website to programming. The world is changing and technology is a major driver of innovation, automation and artificial intelligence transforming the industries we work in. It's hard to keep up with new technologies or integrate them into our fields.

Learning new skills takes time and getting the time whilst working as a professional in a narrow field it's difficult to seek direction with our learning. We provide top-notch resources for professionals applicable to multiple industries to learn new skills and broaden your interests. Weather you're looking for professional development, personal growth, or just a fun hobby we provide what you'll need!

While being run entirely by one person allows us to maintain a high level of quality and consistency in our content, it also means that we are limited in the amount of content that we can produce in a given time period. Know that we are working hard to create and release new articles and tutorials as quickly as we can and we appreciate your patience and understanding. We hope that you will continue to visit our website and take advantage of the resources that we have available. If you have any feedback or suggestions for future content, we would love to hear from you.
